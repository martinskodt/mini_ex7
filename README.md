### [Form Face](https://martinskodt.github.io/mini_ex7/)
This program is the colmination of a lot of ideas. And ended up as quite a mess if I say so myself. The idea behind the program is to break the usual form in any way my coding skills allowed me to. This concept gave me, a thousand ideas for different functions, that break and bend the usual way of using buttons. But after al lot of different ideas ended up being too difficult or too time consuming. In ended up with a face of buttons and select. That isn’t very pretty or very functional. But that is kinda the idea. To break the conventions.

### Objekt oriented programming
The face is programmed as an object. That initially had a purpose of duplicating itself in the place of the mouse (which also can be seen in the commented-out parts of the code). This kind of structuring of your code is very helpful when you are dealing with a lot of code. It helps you manipulate the specific feature u want to change fast. And make change happen to potentially a lot of objects in the program. That could otherwise have been a ridicules amount of copy-pasting. I don’t really know what kind of limitations objects have. It can be hard, when you want similar objects but with different functionality. But otherwise, it just comes down to how much code you want to type.
Using p5.dom objects seems very limited. In my case not knowing any HTML or CSS the dom objekts is a nice little gateway of bringing some functionality to your site. But it feels very limited. Also the explanations on the p5 describes the dom elements like you have knowledge HTML and CSS. Which limits your abilities a lot.
